# Vincent

Vincent - was created for personal purposes to organize my photos.

Features which I need from this tool:

1. I have realized for myself that not need to sort my photos manually, because only ordered by time frames is the best way to see the photos
It's like stream of your life.
That's why first required feature is 
"organize  photos automatically by creation date using standart file system with human readable structure"
like "Flower Beds in Holland"

2. I'm often copy some of my photos from camera to PC again again and again and as result have a lot of duplicates
and the use a lot of memory.  that's why second required feature is
"no duplicates - just delete them from my hard drive."
like "Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear"

3. Since my photos are located on external drive, it is required to have a tool which is located on that drive
and it should work on all OS.
like "Vase with Fifteen Sunflowers"

4. And this tool must do the job fast.
you know "A pair of Leather Clogs" and "Undergrowth With A Couple"

5. And fun "Still Life with Absinthe" in  "Bedroom in Arles"
